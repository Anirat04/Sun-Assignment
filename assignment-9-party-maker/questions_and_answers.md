</p>
</details>

###### 5. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

<i>The code counts how many non zero numbers are in the `nums` array. It starts with a count of 0 and go through each number in the array. If the number is not zero, it adds 1 to the count. Finally it prints the total count, which is the number of non-zero element in the array. In this example, there are three non zero numbers (`1`, `2`, and `3`), so the output is `3`.</i>
